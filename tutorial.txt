1.Download Createcommand.sh
2.(Say it is downloaded to Downloads)
root@bt:~/Downloads#  chmod 777 Createcommand.sh
root@bt:~/Downloads#  ./Createcommand.sh Createcommand.sh Createcommand
3.Done!!!

Now..
You can create a simple sh file with commands in it.
say sample.sh that has - "ls"
to create a command "sampleexec" that executes "ls" at any path..
just type in - 'Createcommand sample.sh sampleexec'
Now just type in 'sample' anywhere in your shell..it will execute sample.sh! :D
